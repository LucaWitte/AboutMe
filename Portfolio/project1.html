               <h2>Blender Animations</h2>
               <p>Will add more details in the future. I played around with blender a bit in the past year or two, here is some things I created. <br><br>
               More info coming soon
               </p>

               <h2>A Donut</h2>
              
               <p>As is tradition in the Blender community, one of the first things I made was a donut</p>

               <!-- Detailed description -->
               <h2>Chess</h2>
              
               <p> I made chess figures. Part of this experiment was to give them very different appearences and textures. In the example images (more to come), you can see figures made from polished marble, neon mesh figures and shiny, floating pieces with a synthetic/futuristic vibe. </p>

               <img src="../Images/Chess2.png" alt="Chess models 2" class="project-image">

               <p>I also worked on making a board for them to create a whole set (not sure which style to choose yet). <br><br>
                  I would like to use them to actually make a playable game at some point by coding chess from scratch. Not sure when I will find the time though :( </p>

               <h2>To be updated</h2>
              
               <p>While I played Dungeons and Dragons with a group of good friends, I tried to model my character with the goal to 3d print it later on. I will add later how miserable my monk looked and how much time I wasted on modelling it. Stay tuned!</p>
