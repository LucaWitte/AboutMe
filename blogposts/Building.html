                   The Limitations of Bioengineering

    Professional Restrictions
        Need for specialized lab equipment
            Microscopes, centrifuges, sterile environments
        Regulatory hurdles
            Ethical approvals for experiments
            Compliance with safety standards
    Resource Intensive
        High costs of materials and equipment
        Dependence on institutional support
    Time-Consuming Processes
        Long experimentation cycles
        Delayed gratification from slow results
    Limited DIY Opportunities
        Safety risks prevent home experiments
        Lack of open-source platforms for bioengineering

Discovering Electrical Engineering

    Initial Spark
        Exposure to a maker space or electronics workshop
        Curiosity about how everyday devices work
    First Projects
        Building simple circuits
        Experimenting with Arduino or Raspberry Pi
    Role of 3D Printing
        Creating physical components for projects
        Rapid prototyping capabilities

Accessibility of Building with Electronics

    Affordable Tools and Materials
        Low-cost microcontrollers and sensors
        Second-hand equipment availability
    Online Resources
        Tutorials, forums, and YouTube channels
        Open-source software and hardware communities
    Minimal Regulatory Barriers
        Freedom to experiment without stringent regulations
        Safety manageable at home with proper precautions
    Immediate Feedback
        Quick iteration cycles
        Visible results encourage continued learning

The Joy of Creation

    Empowerment
        Turning ideas into tangible objects
        Overcoming challenges through problem-solving
    Community Engagement
        Collaborating with other makers
        Participating in hackathons or maker fairs
    Personal Growth
        Developing new skills in coding and design
        Boosting confidence through successful projects

Contrasting Bioengineering and Electrical Engineering

    Scalability of Projects
        Bioengineering projects often large-scale and collaborative
        Electronics projects scalable from simple to complex
    Innovation Pace
        Faster innovation cycles in electronics
        Bioengineering advancements slower due to testing requirements
    Accessibility for Hobbyists
        Electronics welcoming to beginners
        Bioengineering less accessible outside professional settings

Encouraging Others to Build

    Embracing the Maker Mindset
        Encouraging curiosity and experimentation
    Starting Small
        Recommending beginner-friendly projects
        Suggesting resources and communities to join
    Long-Term Benefits
        Skill development applicable to various fields
        Potential to inspire career shifts or new hobbies
